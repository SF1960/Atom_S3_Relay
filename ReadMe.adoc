= Project: {Remote relay control via Arduino IOT Cloud}

Control an M5 Relay Module using a M5 Atom S3 connected to Arduino IOT

== Step 1: Installation

1. Connect the Relay Module to the Atom
2. Connect a Type-C USB cable to the Atom

== Step 2: Assemble the circuit

1. Upload the code contained in this sketch on to your board
2. Using a separate device connect to WiFi_Select network
3. In the webpage that opens, select your network
4. Enter the password for the network
5. Once connected navigate to your Arduino Dashboard to remotely control device
6. Alternatively, press the screen to toggle output

== Step 3: Function

When switched on, the device attempts to connect to a WiFi network.
If it has previously connected to a nearby network then it will.
Otherwise, it will display a message asking the user to chose **_Select_WiFi_**
from a list of available networks. Once seleted, a webpage will open listing
available networks. Select your network and add the password.
The device will connect to the network and then Arduino Cloud.
Once connected, the display will show **~** either side of the screen status prompt.

**CONNECTED**
~ [**ON**] ~ or ~ [**OFF**] ~

**To turn the relay on and off.**

1. Press the screen
2. Use the Arduino dashboard 

**To turn the display on and off.**

1. Use the Arduino dashboard (**_The screen is forced ON when not connected_**)
